This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# turn off sci notation
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(refinr)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
police_shootings <- read_csv("fatal-police-shootings-data.csv")
```

```{r}
police_shootings %>% 
filter(str_detect(gender, "female")) %>% 
  filter(date<"2020-09-04") %>% 
  summarise(count=n())
```
